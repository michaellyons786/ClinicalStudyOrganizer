# Three Laws of TDD
Taken from Robert C. Martin's *Clean Code*

## 1st Law
You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test.

## 2nd Law
You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.

## 3rd Law
You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.
